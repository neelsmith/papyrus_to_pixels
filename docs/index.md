## Announcements

- **Feb. 1**: Copy and paste the opening sentence of Edward Everett's oration at Gettysburg into your Pluto notebook.

> STANDING beneath this serene sky, overlooking these broad fields now reposing from the labors of the waning year, the mighty Alleghenies dimly towering before us, the graves of our brethren beneath our feet, it is with hesitation that I raise my poor voice to break the eloquent silence of God and Nature. But the duty to which you have called me must be performed;â€“grant me, I pray you, your indulgence and your sympathy.
