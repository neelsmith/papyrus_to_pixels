# Papyrus to Pixels: home page

## Welcome!

Classics 199-S05, "Papyrus to Pixels," is offered jointly this semester with BIO 199-S02, "Change Through Time."  Our two courses will meet together in O'Neil 101 on several occasions. (*NB: including the first day of class*!)  When the courses meet separately, CLAS 199-S05 will meet in Fenwick 420.

Our coordinated courses are organized in three main sections:

1. Modelling species and texts
2. Classifying species and texts
3. Interpreting change through time

A major part of your course assignments will focus on hands-on work, including:

1. [Small-group labs](./labs/) modelling, classifying and interpreting evolution/transmission
2. Developing an [original research project](./project/)


## Week at a glance: Jan. 23 - 25

We meet in O'Neil 101 for both classes this week.

We will introduce the course's subject matter on Tuesday. Jim Cahill from Educational Design and Digital Media Services will visit us on Thursday, as we  introduce and test the technologies we will rely on this semester.
