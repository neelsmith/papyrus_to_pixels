> ***Reading Greek mythology using data science*** *and/or* ***A first encounter with data science through Greek mythology***



## Rubric for final written submission
 
### Content

You should explicitly address the following topics:

- what is the question you want to investigate?
- what source material are you using?
- how are you analyzing the material? 
- what conclusions did you reach? Your conclusions should be supported by specific reference to replicable work
- if you created an analytical tool that can be generally applied to your source material or to other sources, be sure that you illustrate your conclusion with a concrete application of your work

### Format
 
 Your should submit two versions of your final submission:
 
- one in a  a format where can code be executed live (e.g., a Pluto notebook)
- one in a format where text can be printed (e.g., a PDF)

### Reproducible scholarship

You should identify:

- a legal license for your original work
- where I can find your source data
- how I can replicate your work



## Deadlines for final project work

- oral presentation in class (Thurs. Nov. 30, Tues. Dec. 5)
- written submission: final version added to your Google course folder before Tues., Dec 12


## Challenges you can try

- A challenge: [rework a notebook for a presentation](./julia/rework-nb.jl) (Pluto notebook format, so download it and open in Pluto)
- [Try some ideas from 5-minute presentations](./classes/sprint1/)


## Some links for working on projects and presentations

> **Note**: *This is a Pluto notebook, so download and open in Pluto to use it*.


- A *Pluto notebook* with notes on [presentations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/digitalmyth/main/pluto/presentation-notes.jl)

## Links from presentations extending initial group work

> **Note**: *These links are HTML files you can open in a Web browser: you'll have to save them as a  Pluto notebook if you want to run them in Pluto*.
