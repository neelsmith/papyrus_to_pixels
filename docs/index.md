# Papyrus to Pixels: home page

Main sections of course content:

- Modelling species and texts
- Classifying species and texts
- Interpreting change through time

Meta-goals:

- work collaboratively
- cultivate habits of test-driven thinking:
    - hypotheses are wrong until proven otherwise
    - to know if a test works, you must first fail it
- develop a reproducible research project from an initial question to implementation, including
    - explicit license for reuse
    - source material and analytical methods identified
- oral presentation 
- written presentation: one source, multiple formats


Hands-on course activities:

1. [Small-group labs](./labs/) modelling, classifying and interpreting evolution/transmission
2. Developing an [original research project](./project/)
