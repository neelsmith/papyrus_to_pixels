# What are evolution and textual transmission, and what do they have to do with code?

## Class preparation

### Before coming to class

http://localhost:4000/syllabus/expect/

The course emphasizes hands-on work, and you are expected to be able to use a computer to follow this basic sequence of tasks on your personal computer, or the computer you are using in a lab:

Given a link to a text file on the internet, download the file and save it to the computer.
Find the saved file on the computer, and open it with a text editor.
Before our first hands-on class session on Thursday, Jan. 25, please make sure that you are comfortable doing this. If you have questions or need help, you can get help from Educational Design and Digital Media Services.


### 1. Defining evolution and textual transmission

> **TBA**

### 2. Preparing to write code

This semester, we'll explore texts and biological data using the Julia programming language. If you have a computer, before coming to class, you should download and install Julia on your computer. If you don't have access to a computer, you will be able to use the machines in the Classics Department's research lab in Fenwick 406.  (Please speak with Prof. Smith if you would like to have access to the Fenwick 406 outside of regular work hours when the Classics Department Administrator can let you in.)


## In class

Bring a computer with you, and be prepared to open a Julia terminal or REPL.
