# What are evolution and textual transmission, and what do they have to do with code?

## Class preparation

### 1. Defining evolution and textual transmission

> **TBA**

### 2. Preparing to write code

This semester, we'll explore texts and biological data using the Julia programming language. If you have a computer, before coming to class, you should download and install Julia on your computer. If you don't have access to a computer, you will be able to use the machines in the Classics Department's research lab in Fenwick 406.  (Please speak with Prof. Smith if you would like to have access to the Fenwick 406 outside of regular work hours when the Classics Department Administrator can let you in.)

## In class

Bring a computer with you, and be prepared to open a Julia terminal or REPL.
