# Exploring texts using Julia in the REPL

In this class, we'll begin to use the Julia REPL to explore texts of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.

## Contract for group work

Please download and complete the contract for group work availabe in the course Google drive. Print a copy of your completed contract, and submit one hard copy of the contract signed by all members of your group.

While digital assignments are due at 12:00 pm, this hard-copy requirement is instead due 2:00 when you come to class.

## Class preparation


1. Read the two introductory paragraphs about the Gettysburg Address on this page from [abrahamlincolnonline.org](https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm)
2. If you have followed the instructions in [the previous class preparation assignment to install Julia on your computer](../content+tech1/), make sure you can open a Julia REPL (or interactive terminal) on your computer.


## In class

Bring a laptop to class.  We'll begin to learn how to use the Julia language interactively.
