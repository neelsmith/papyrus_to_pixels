# Welcome to "Papyrus to Pixels"!

Please note: we will meet jointly today with Biology 199-S02, "Change Through Time," in O'Neil 101.

There is no class preparation for our introductory meeting, but if you have found your way here, feel free to explore the course web site, and bring up any questions you might have in class today!
