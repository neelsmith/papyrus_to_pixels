# Project ideas


## Before coming to class

In your labs and in classes, you've explored different kinds of questions we can ask about digital texts, and in particular different kinds of questions about how we might compare or relate texts.   In today's class, we will define initial ideas for a project you will develop over the next five weeks.

There are many ways to find a starting point for a research question. You might be interested in a particular kind of question or method. For example, you might decide that you'd really like to work on a project that tries to find similar content in different texts, but not have a definite idea about what texts to study.  Or you might be interested in a particular text or set of texts and be uncertain about what exactly you want to learn about them. You  might, for example, decide that you're specifically interested in texts about Greek mythology, but not sure how to compare them.

In preparation for today's class, you should bring a list of ideas for each approach:

1. list at least one or two kinds of questions you might find interesting
2. list at least one or two texts or groups of texts you might want to study


## In class

In class, we will discuss different initial ideas for projects, and will define groups for your fourth lab assingment and indepedent project.
