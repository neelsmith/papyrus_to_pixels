# Rhetorical style at Gettysburg

## Data structures

In your previous class preparation, you proposed a data model for comparing orations.   Read the following passage from an ancient handbook on rhetoric by Cicero, entitled *Ad Herennium* ("Guidebook to rhetoric for Herennius"): [selection from Cicero](./ad_herennium). Cicero proposes a kind of sliding scale of styles, from the "Simple" style at one end to the "Grand" style at the other, and gives examples of each, but doesn't tell us specifically what to look for in each example. We'll try to improve on Cicero by collecting specific, identified observations using the data model you developed for the previous class.

How should we collect those observations?  We could simply read Lincoln and Everett's speeches, and take notes.

But what if we wanted to apply our model more widely?  Would if we wanted to compare each of Lincoln's and Everett's speeches to a large corpus of nineteenth-century rhetoric? That change of scale might further suggest whether one or the other speaker at Gettysburg was more or less typical of contemporary oratory.  At some point, manually collecting observations is no longer feasible, and we need to learn how to automate that part of our work.  We need to write code that will collect our observations from a digital corpus.

At this point, we are translating *data models* into digital *data structures*.  In our first hands-on exercise in class, we will learn how to do that, and will begin to apply our digital implementation of your models to Linconln and Everett's speeches.
