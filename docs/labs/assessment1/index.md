# Assessing lab assignments

Before beginning your assessment, please review the group contract that you signed before beginning your collaborative work.  

Your assessment should  keep in mind that the most effective collaboration draws on the experience, perspective and skills of everyone in your team. This includes: getting and keeping the team organized, coming up with ideas, doing background research, trying out ideas that may or may not work, producing a first draft of required submissions, giving and receiving feedback, refining initial work, considering and incorporating ideas that others come up with, editing, taking responsibility for the quality of the final product, motivating others, supporting others, encouraging all team members and including their contributions, and bringing positive energy to the work. You may be able to articulate additional qualities that you have found important and helpful.

Be honest, respectful and constructive in the peer evaluations you provide. Constructive criticism aims to aid in the improvement, development, and advancement of the receiver.  Only constructive criticism will be (anonymously) shared with your peers. If you identify any concerns that you cannot express as constructive criticism, please bring those concerns directly to me.

I will summarize aggregate results before sharing anonymized responses with you.
