# Data form for Lab 3


For any language other than English that you speak or have studied, please create a simple two-column table providing a comparable or equivalent term for each English word in the list below. If you have familiarity with more than one language other than English, feel free to include as many columns as you like in the table! 


## Formatting a plain-text data set

Your table should have each vocabulary item on one line of a plain text file. *Rows* of your data set represent a single term.  Use a vertical pipe character `|` to separate *columns*, with one column for each language you are including in your survey.

The first row of your file should be a header line with *labels* for each column.  For example, if you were surveying terms in French, your table might start like this:

```
English|French
father|père
mother|mère
```

Save the file as a plain-text file named `${LASTNAME}-languagedata.txt`, replacing `{LASTNAME}` with your last name, and add the file to your personal folder on the course Google Drive.



## List of vocabulary to compare

Your submitted file should have entries for each of the following terms. If you don't know or can't find the corresponding term in the language you are surveying, keep the English term in its proper place and leave the column empty for the term in the other language.
