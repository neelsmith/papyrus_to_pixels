# Linguistic evolution

How does language evolve?


## Data model

In this exercise, we will use a very minimal data model of language: we will compare individual vocabulary items with similar meaning in different languages, and try to construct an evolutionary tree based on the words' sound structure (their *phonology*).

## Ways this model fails

- We take no account of how words change forms to express different ideas (their *morphology*), such as the different forms of singular and plural nouns in English.  
- We take no account of how words are composed or arranged to express meaning (their *syntax*).
