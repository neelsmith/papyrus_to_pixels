# Linguistic evolution

How does language evolve?


## Data model

In this exercise, we will use a very minimal data model of language: we will compare individual vocabulary items with similar meaning in different languages, and try to construct an evolutionary tree based on the words' sound structure (their *phonology*).

## Ways this model fails

- We take no account of how words change forms to express different ideas (their *morphology*), such as the different forms of singular and plural nouns in English.  
- We take no account of how words are composed or arranged to express meaning (their *syntax*).




## Assignment

A template Pluto notebook is available in two formats:


- [as a web page](./lab-language.html) (HTML file)
- [as a Julia notebook](../../../pluto/lab-language.jl) (`.jl` filename)

You may either download the Julia notebook directly and open it in Pluto on your computer, or read [the web page](./lab-dna.html), and use the "Edit or run" button to download the web page as a notebook file. If you don't remember from lab 1 how to do that, you can refer to these  guides:

- [running Pluto](../../julia)
- [opening a notebook saved as a web page](../../julia/pluto)
