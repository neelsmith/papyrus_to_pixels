# Matching sequences in DNA

## Relating features

In class, you have learned about the relation between amino acids and codons (sequences of three nucleotides). You will model a sequence of nucleotides in both ways: as a sequence of amino acids, and as a sequence of codons. Your features' data will then be in two parallel vectors of the same length. You will use dictionaries in Julia to explore the relations between these two features.

This is a general pattern you could apply to many kinds of research questions.


## Assignment

A template Pluto notebook is available in two formats:


- [as a web page](./lab-dna.html) (HTML file)
- [as a Julia notebook](../../../pluto/lab-dna.jl) (`.jl`)

You may either download the Julia notebook directly and open it in Pluto on your computer, or read [the web page](./lab-dna.html), and use the "Edit or run" button to download the web page as a notebook file. If you don't remember from lab 1 how to do that, you can refer to these  guides:

- [running Pluto](../../julia)
- [opening a notebook saved as a web page](../../julia/pluto)



### Requirements for satisfactory submission

1. Complete the template notebook.
2. Save your completed notebook using the "Notebook file" option.  If you need help doing this, see "[Saving a notebook](../../pluto/julia/)"
3. On your computer, find the file you saved, and name it `{LASTNAME}-lab2.jl`, replacing `{LASTNAME}` with your last name.
4. Add the correctly named file to your personal folder on the course Google drive. 
5. Ensure that every member of your team successfully completes the steps to submit a notebook. The first part of your notebooks should be identical: only the final sections "Next steps" and "Reflection" should differ (although you're free to discuss this with your teammates and share ideas).
