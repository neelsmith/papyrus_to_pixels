## Collaborative assignments

> A single submission for the entire team

1. [rhetorical style in the Gettysburg Address](./lab1/) (modeling texts)
2. [comparing sequences in DNA](./lab2/) (classifying species)
3. ? (Perhaps a lab on feature extraction: [identifying named entities in texts](./lab3/?)
4. ? (Something with similarity and classification.  Matrix similarity to [compare multiple translations](./lab4/) of Bible?)

Possible demos to prompt thinking about project possibilities:

- Topic modelling to compare multiple translations of the Bible
- CheapGPT: an n-gram based text generator
- deriving evolutionary trees
