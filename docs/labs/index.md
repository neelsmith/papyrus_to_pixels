# Labs


## Prerequisites

- complete Google form with schedule
- contract for collaborative work


## Collaborative assignments

> A single submission for the entire team

1. rhetorical style in the Gettysburg Address (modeling texts)
2. comparing sequences in DNA (classifying species)
3. ? (Perhaps a lab on feature extraction: identifying named entities in texts?)
4. ? (Something with similarity and classification.  Matrix similarity of multiple translations of the same text using edit distance?)

Possible demos to prompt thinking about "Extending project" ideas:

- Topic modelling to compare multiple translations of the Bible
- CheapGPT: an n-gram based text generator
