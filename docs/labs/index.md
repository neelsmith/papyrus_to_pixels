# Lab assignments


## Collaboration

In the first section of the course, you will work in small teams to complete a series of hands-on lab assignments.  Based on responses to the [initial course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11tgd9yTntxP0_2yuO199p0tAhjGgFCk-9Jvy_Ve68eQ/edit?ts=65a96ef8)  (due Wednesday, Jan. 24, at 12:00), you will be assigned to a team for the first three lab assignments,  including students from both BIO 199 and CLAS 199. Each team will complete a work contract, and bring a signed copy of the contract to class on Tuesday, Jan. 30.

For the fourth lab assignment, you will work in a group formed from students in CLAS 199. This group will also complete a work contract and turn in a signed copy.


## Format

For each lab assigment, you will be given a template Pluto notebook to work from.  The template notebook includes some provided scaffolding sections, and other sections you will need to complete. You will submit each lab assignment by adding a copy of your completed notebook to your personal folder on the Google course drive. For more detail, see the instructions for each assignment (linked below).

## Common structure

All four lab assignments have a common outline, that could be summarized as:

1. define the goal or problem you want to solve
2. break down and identify specific subproblems to achieve the goal of the assignment.  For each subproblem,
    1. define a test to assess whether your solution is value. Note that your test should initially *fail*!
    2. successfully implement a solution to the subproblem, and verify your success by passing your test(s).
3. complete a prompted reflection on the assingment
