# Revising lab assignments

1. Prof. Ober or I will respond by email to everyone individually. Our goal is to get you a reply within about 24 hours after the class on the day of submission. That way, you'll have our responses in hand before our next class meeting.
2. Each assignment will have a final deadline for submitting revisions. You may submit as many revisions as you like up until the deadline.
3. To submit a revision, you must add a file to your personal folder with the same name as the original file, with the addition to the base name of a hyphen, the character "v" and a  version number. E.g., for an orginal submission `Smith-lab1.jl`, I could add a revision named `Smith-lab1-v2.jl.`
4. If you have questions about whether your revision is satisfactory, you must do that in person with one of us. Show up at drop in hours, or make an appointment to see us. We'll open your submission and look it over together then.
