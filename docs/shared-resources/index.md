# Shared resources

While the required [lab assignments](../labs/) are uniform for everyone in the class, your work on an [original project](../project/) is unique to you or your team. In your project work, however, you may find solutions to common problems that others in the course could benefit from.  This brief assignment therefore asks you to share the fruits of your experience with the other members of our class. You may complete this assignment individually or in a group of your choosing.


## Process

There are only two parts to this assignment.

### Develop an approved topic

**Step 1**: By April 2, you will submit a suggestion for something you could share with the rest of the class, and must meet me with outside of class time prior to submitting a suggested topic.

For most students, the contribution could be a concrete solution to a subproblem you identified and solved in the course of your working on your labs or your project, but this is the most flexible requirement in the course, and in some cases your contribution might take a different form.  We will discuss ideas together in class, and through the early part of the semester  will add a list of suggestions to these guidelines.


**Step 2**: Once your topic has been approved, you wil be given a set of requirements specifying what exactly constitutes a successful submission for  your contribution. These will be unique to each contributor.
