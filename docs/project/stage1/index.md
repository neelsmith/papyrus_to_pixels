# Initial project idea

Your project will raise an original question about some text or body of texts. The question may be very limited in scope: we have very limited time before the end of the semester. 

We will define an initial idea and form project teams in class on March 19:  please see [instructions for class preparation](../../classes/project-ideas/).
