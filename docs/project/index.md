# Original project

In the final section of the course, you will develop an original research project (either individually, or in a group of your choice), addressing a question you define. You will design your project to be openly available and replicable by other scholars, and to be accessible and intelligible to a non-specialist audience. 

In developing your final submission, you will take account of the digital basis of your research.  You will design a single source document from which you will produce two final submissions: a document suitable for reading in hard copy (e.g., a PDF), and an document allowing interactive execution of any code you apply in your analysis.

## Process


You will develop the project in five stages. You must complete each stage successfully before advancing the next stage. For example, you may not complete (and receive credit for) the final stage (a written submission in two formats) until you have successfully completed the four preceding phases.

Please refer to the detailed instructions for each phase of the project.
