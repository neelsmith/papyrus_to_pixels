# Original project


In the final section of the course, you will develop an original research project, either individually, or in a group of your choice.

You will develop the project in five stages. You must complete each stage successfully before advancing the next stage. For example, you may not complete (and receive credit for) the final stage, a written submission in two formats, until you have successfully completed the four preceding phases.


1. [Idea for a topic](./stage1/)
2. [Formal project proposal](./stage2/)
3. [Draft of implementation](./stage3/)
4. [5-minute presentation to class](./stage4/)
5. [Written submission in two formats](./stage5/)
