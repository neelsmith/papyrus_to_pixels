You should explicitly address the following topics:

- what is the question you want to investigate?
- what source material are you using?
- how are you analyzing the material?
- what conclusions did you reach? Your conclusions should be supported by specific reference to replicable work
- if you created an analytical tool that can be generally applied to your source material or to other sources, be sure that you illustrate your conclusion with a concrete application of your work

- one in a format where text can be printed (e.g., a PDF)
