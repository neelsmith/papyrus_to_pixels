# Resources for working with Julia


## Installing Pluto

See the separate page on [installing Julia and Pluto](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/techprereqs/).

## Running Pluto

- To start Pluto, in a Julia REPL, enter `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`. 
- To stop  Pluto, at the same REPL prompt, enter  `Ctl-C`` (the control key + c). This will put you back at the initial `julia` prompt in your REPL. You may continue to work in Julia or use `exit()` to quit the REPL.


## Saving and opening notebooks in Pluto

See the separate page on [saving and opening notebooks in Pluto](./pluto/)


## Using Pluto in the cloud

See the separate page on ways to [use a Pluto notebook without running Pluto](./cloud/) on your machine.

## Introduction to the Julia language in Pluto notebooks

> These Pluto notebooks are viewable here as HTML pages you can read in a web browser: save them to your computer in Pluto notebook format and open them in Pluto  to run them live.

- the [nouns and verbs](./julia-nouns-verbs.html) of the Julia language
- [collections of data](./julia-collections-of-data.html) (including the basic scholarly operations: *filter* and *map*)

## Some common tasks illustrated in Pluto notebooks


- [file I/O](./fileio.html): reading from and writing to files
- creating matrices in Julia: modelling a [feature matrix](./featurematrix.html)

## Other nifty stuff

- plot tree relationships using [Mermaid flowcharts](./sketch-tree.html)
