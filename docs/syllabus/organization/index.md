# On-line course material and technical prerequisites



## On-line resources 

1. On-line course material is available on the [course web site](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/). You will also have access to a course Google drive, where we may post copies of copyrighted reading material. 
2. You will have access to a personal folder on the course Google drive. You will submit assignments by dropping a file into your individual folder. (Other students do not have access to your individual folder.)
3. When you use your Holy Cross Google login, you can have free access to a specialized version of ChatGPT trained to generate code in the Julia language, called AskAI. AskAI is available online [here](https://juliahub.com/ui/AskAI). 

Any supplementary hard-copy material will be distributed in class. There is no textbook, and no Canvas site for CLAS 199-S05.



## Technical requisites

As part of your lab assignments, you will learn how to write code in the Julia language. You will want to install Julia on your personal computer (you can follow [directions on the course web site](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/techprereqs/)), or speak with Prof. Smith about access to the Classics Department research lab, where machines have Julia installed.
