# Goals

Shared goals with both sections:


- work collaboratively
- cultivate habits of test-driven thinking:
    - hypotheses are wrong until proven otherwise
    - to know if a test works, you must first fail it
    - iteratively improve
- develop a reproducible research project from an initial question to implementation, including
    - explicit license for reuse
    - source material and analytical methods identified
- oral presentation 
- written presentation: one source, multiple formats
