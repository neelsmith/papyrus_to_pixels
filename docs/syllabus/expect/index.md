# What to expect 

There are no formal prerequisites for this course: it is intended to be accessible to any Holy Cross student. In class work, and especially in an extended course project, you will have opportunities to contribute to the course by drawing on your own experiences and interests.

The course emphasizes hands-on work, and you are expected to be able to use a computer to follow this basic sequence of tasks on your personal computer, or the computer you are using in a lab:

1. Given a link to a text file on the internet, download the and save it to the computer.
2. Find the saved file on the computer, and open it with a text editor.


Before our first hands-on class session on Thursday, Jan. 25, please make sure that you are comfortable doing this. If you have questions or need help, you can get help from [Educational Design and Digital Media Services](https://www.holycross.edu/educational-design-and-digital-media-services).
