# Policies



## Class attendance



Work in class is an essential component of the course, and regular attendance is required. (See the course grading rubric in this syllabus for how class attendance contributes to your final course grade.) Excused absences do not count against your course grade. If you know of scheduled conflicts with class meeting times, please speak with me as soon as possible to make arrangements ahead of time for how best to make up work for an excused absence.

If you are sick or have symptoms of a possible communicable disease such as COVID or flu, on the other hand, please do not come to class. You should get in touch with me by email as soon as possible to make arrangements for following up on an unplanned excused absence.


## Masking and testing

 In January, 2024, COVID infections are again on the rise. It is impossible to foresee how the spread of infections will develop this semester, and we continue to teach and learn in ways we did not anticipate. I will monitor the spread of the virus and re-evaluate our masking practices periodically throughout the semester.

Because even a “mild” case can have serious consequences for at-risk populations, as the semester begins, medical-grade or better masks are required for class meetings in Fenwick 420, and for drop-in hours in my office (Fenwick 415) until further notice.

Masking is uncomfortable for us all, but feeling unsafe creates a poor learning environment so please do your part. Please continue to proactively monitor, test, and isolate at the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and close contact with any individuals with known infections. We will continue to closely monitor viral surges and current College recommendations in regards to COVID-19 and any other infectious diseases that might emerge as we move through the semester.



## Diversity and Inclusivity

The study of texts and other cultural material belongs to everyone: there are no special privileges or claims of ownership. This course has no rerequisites. The diversity of experience and perspectives that we collectively bring to the class is a resource, a strength and a shared benefit for all of us.

## Accommodations for disabilities

Any student who feels the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Services to discuss support services available. The office can be reached by calling 508 793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 215A.

If you are already registered with Disability Services, please let me know as soon as possible, so that I can take account of this in planning for tests or other course activities.
