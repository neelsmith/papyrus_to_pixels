# Preparing to work with Julia




- Download Julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- Follow these instructions to install Julia:
    - [installing Julia on Windows](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#windows)
    - [installing Julia on Mac OS](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#macos)
    - [installing Julia on Linux](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd)

Throughout the semester, we will stress the importance of defining tests before we write code: how can we know if our code is functioning correctly?

To test whether you have installed Julia correctly, try to open a julia terminal (or REPL, for "Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop").  You should see something like this:

If you do, great!  At the `julia>` prompt, enter `exit()` to quit the REPL.
