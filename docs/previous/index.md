2. Classifying species and texts
3. Interpreting change through time

A major part of your course assignments will focus on hands-on work, including:

1. [Small-group labs](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/labs/) modelling, classifying and interpreting evolution/transmission
2. Developing an [original research project](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/project/)
