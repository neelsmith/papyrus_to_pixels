# Overview of previous weeks



## Welcome!

Classics 199-S05, "Papyrus to Pixels," is offered jointly this semester with BIO 199-S02, "Change Through Time."  Our two courses will meet together in O'Neil 101 on several occasions. (***NB: including the first day of class***!)  When the courses meet separately, CLAS 199-S05 will meet in Fenwick 420.

Our coordinated courses are organized in three main sections:

1. Modelling species and texts
2. Classifying species and texts
3. Interpreting change through time

A major part of your course assignments will focus on hands-on work, including:

1. [Small-group labs](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/labs/) modelling, classifying and interpreting evolution/transmission
2. Developing an [original research project](https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/project/)
