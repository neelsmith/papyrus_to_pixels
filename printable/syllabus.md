# Course requirements and grades

You determine your own course grade by satisfactorily completing a number of assignments in these categories:

 1. four lab assignments, completed in small groups
 2. a longer research project completed in multiple stages
 3. a contribution to a collection of course resources
 4. class attendance

All assignments will be graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory according to an explicit specification of requirements: if you complete *all* requirements, the assignment is satisfactory. If you complete an assignment and submit it on time, but it fails to satisfy all requirements, you will have opportunities to revise the assignment to receive full credit for it.

The deadline for all written submssions such as lab notebooks is noon on the day of the due date.

## Small-group lab assignments

## Longer research project

## Contribution to a collection of course resources

## Attendance

Being prepared and attending class is an essential part of the learning proces.

We have 39 scheduled class meetings. This table summarizes the scale of attendance points:

| Class meetings attended |	Points earned |
| --- | --- |
| 37+ |	6 |

36	5
34	4
32	3
30	2
< 22	0
The total points you can earn in this category is 6.

## Determination of final course grade

For each category except the CBL project, the preceding sections define the *maximum* number of assignments. If the daily course schedule changes, and we have fewer than the maximum number of assignments, you will receive full credit for any dropped assignments. For example, if we have 7 in-class language assessments instead of the maximum of 8, you will receive 2 points for the omitted assignment; that plus your points on the seven completed assignments would be your total for the semester in the category of language assessments.

Your course grade will be recorded from the following table.  In the row for each grade, the numbers in each column represent the minimum number of points required in that category.

| Course grade |  Portfolio (18) | Homework (12) | Vocab. assessments (20) | Language assessments  (16) | CBL participation | CBL project |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
| A |17 | 12 | 18 |  16 | 9| 6 |
