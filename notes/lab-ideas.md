Lab 3: feature extraction: 
[identifying named entities in texts](./lab3/?)

Lab4 : similarity and classification.  Matrix similarity to [compare multiple translations](./lab4/) of Bible?)

Possible demos to prompt thinking about project possibilities:

- Topic modelling to compare multiple translations of the Bible
- CheapGPT: an n-gram based text generator
- deriving evolutionary trees
