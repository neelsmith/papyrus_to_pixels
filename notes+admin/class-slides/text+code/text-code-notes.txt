TECH SETUP: expect to be wrong; devise a test

1. We devised a test, and we were wrong!  Thanks!

2. Fix it! Grading scheme matches our goals: revise by 12:00 on Monday for full credit.


GROUP COMPACTS
Collaboration is hard. 6 areas you'll draft an agreement for

TEXTUAL XMISSION

- Date of Lucretius? 1st c BCE
- Date of MS: !!!

This is typical.

Why the big gap?

What factors affect survival?

We need to think about this to understand *transmission*; it's a *process* so what *mechanisms* explain it?


WHY JULIA?

- goals: for a CS major, programming skill includes choosing language for task, easily switching to "best" choice. Optimizing your coding skills

- for a BIO or CLAS major: optimization is *your time* and getting value out of your domain expertise SO over a 4-year UG career

--> choose ONE language you can be proficient in 

Julia:

- many contexts: notebooks; REPL; scripts; distributed computing and numerically intense computation (climate modeling, finance)

- modern language: (pkg mgmt; Unicode! Testing and other modern ideas BUILT INTO core language) 

(CS majors: slightly different model from OO you've learned)

FOCUS NEXT WEEK;

- nouns/verbs
- collections of data and the 2 central computational operations of scholarly work with data
