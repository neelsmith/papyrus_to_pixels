lab 2: DNA strings
codon:base::characters:word
64 possible combinations for 3-base codons, but only 20 amino acids. Ie, mapping codons -> amino acids is a (one-way!) many->one mapping that can't be recovered from amino acid values alone.
Our problem: 
1. separate sequence into codons == trigrams
2. map codons -> amino acids
3. compare frequencies of codon trigrams and frequencies of amino acids
4. visualize

amino acids defined funcdtionally; codons structurally
 


Lab 3: feature extraction: 
[identifying named entities in texts](./lab3/?)

Lab4 : similarity and classification.  Matrix similarity to [compare multiple translations](./lab4/) of Bible?)

Possible demos to prompt thinking about project possibilities:

- Topic modelling to compare multiple translations of the Bible
- CheapGPT: an n-gram based text generator
- deriving evolutionary trees
