Welcome to "Papyrus to Pixels"! I look forward to meeting all of you on Tuesday. A few important introductory notes:

1. Our course this semester is offered in coordination with Biology 199-S02, "Change Through Time," taught by Prof. Ober (cc'ed here). We'll have several joint meetings of our two courses *including this week*: our first meeting will be in O'Neill 101. (When our courses meet separately, CLAS 199 will be in Fenwick 420: please don't go there on Tuesday!)

2. Prof. Ober are asking each of you to complete this brief Google form by noon on Wednesday: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11tgd9yTntxP0_2yuO199p0tAhjGgFCk-9Jvy_Ve68eQ/edit?ts=65a96ef8

3. I'll hand out a hard copy of the syllabus when I introduce the course on Tuesday, but if you'd like to get a look at some of our course material ahead of time, our course web site will be at this URL: https://neelsmith.github.io/papyrus_to_pixels/ Feel free to take a look and bring up any questions in class.

See you on Tuesday!
